			<h1> Step 1: ANALYZE</h1>

		</div> 
		<!-- End of Step Title -->



		<div class="stepContent">



		<div class="stepDescription">

			<p>Start by looking over the job description/posting. <strong>DO NOT</strong> FOCUS TOO MUCH ON THE PAY (yet!). The most important aspect of the job description/posting is the responsibilities.</p>
				
				</P>The questions for the interview will be based upon these responsibilities. Pay close attention to minor details.</p>

			<h1>Step 2: RESEARCH</h1>

		</div> <!-- End of Step Title -->



		<div class="stepContent">



		<div class="stepDescription">

			<p>Do your research on the company. Pay attention to which department this is and try to see if you could find a web page or some type of tangible material that will give you more information on this position.</p>
				<P><strong>Do not</strong> go to the company and start making friends with everyone. <strong>Do not</strong> try to contact someone in the department through social media (like LinkedIn) to get more information (you don't want to come off at desperate; <em>they need you</em>; never the opposite).</p>

		<h1>Step 3: Practice Questions/Answers</h1>

	  </div> <!-- end of step title -->

		

		<div class="stepContent">

		

		<div class="stepDescription">

			<p> After extracting as much information as you can, it is time to start developing potential questions. The best way to do this is to go through the key responsibilities identified/understood in Step 1 to create questions and use the research/your own experience to create answers.</p>
				<p>Read aloud and memorize answers to questions. <strong>Do not</strong> memorize question <em>only memorize answers</em>. This helps with the flow of your answers and also helps your mind piece together answer to tough/unexpected questions.</p>

		<h1>Step 4: Build Confidence&nbsp;</h1>

	  </div> <!-- end of step title -->

		

		<div class="stepContent">

		

		<div class="stepDescription">

			<p>As mentioned before, you don't need the company, <em>the company needs you</em>. Try listening to confidence zen music, affirmations, and mediations on YouTube. Go to the gym, stand up to that person who is irritating you, and see yourself being successful in the position.</p>

		<h1>Step 5: Physical Preparedness</h1>

			</div> <!-- end of step title -->

		 

		<div class="stepContent">

		

		<div class="stepDescription">

			

			<p>Wear clean, ironed clothes. Wear a very small amount of cologne but a large amount of deodorant. Take and finish a breath mint before the interview. Drink a little coffee or some type of mild energy booster. Make voice deeper by using exercises found on YouTube. </P>
				<p>Wear a posture corrector. Bring a water, examples of work, diagrams and props. Make eye contact, use hand gestures and always remember: <em><strong>an interview is not a speech, it's not a conversation, it's a performance.</strong></em></p>
